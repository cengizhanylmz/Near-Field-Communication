# Near-Field-Communication
With the STM32L476RG developer card, a project was developed that enables Read/Write operations on the NFC tag. 
The embedded software part and the hardware part of the development board were created with STM32CubeIDE. After the necessary software and hardware were prepared with the integration of the NFC03A1 card reader into the STM32L476RG developer card, the NFC tags detection, reading and writing operations on the tag were performed successfully.
